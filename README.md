# Building a Universal DataLakeHouse with Apache XTable, MinIO, and StarRocks and DeltaStreamer and Interoperate between Hudi, IceBerg, and Delta Tables

## Project-Related Comments

- **Integration Challenges:**
    - *User Comment:* "I faced some challenges integrating Apache XTable with MinIO. Any tips on optimizing the setup for large datasets?" 
    - *Response:* Ensure your MinIO configuration is tuned for high throughput. Consider using multipart uploads and parallel processing to improve performance.

- **Performance Tuning:**
    - *User Comment:* "The query performance on Trino was slower than expected with large tables."
    - *Response:* Make sure to partition your tables effectively and use appropriate indexing strategies. Trino’s configuration might also need adjustments based on your workload.

- **Schema Evolution:**
    - *User Comment:* "How does schema evolution work across these systems, and what should I watch out for?"
    - *Response:* All three systems support schema evolution, but you need to handle schema changes carefully to avoid compatibility issues. Testing schema changes in a staging environment before production can help mitigate risks.

- **Streaming Ingestion:**
    - *User Comment:* "We are planning to use Apache Hudi for real-time data ingestion. Any best practices?"
    - *Response:* Utilize Hudi’s DeltaStreamer for efficient streaming ingestion. Regularly monitor and adjust compaction and cleaning policies to maintain optimal performance.

- **Data Governance:**
    - *User Comment:* "What data governance features are available with these tools?"
    - *Response:* Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg, and Apache Hudi all offer strong data governance features, including ACID transactions, data versioning, and audit logging. Choose the tool that best fits your specific compliance requirements.
